    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation is a Government-registered organization established under the Indian Societies Act of 1860. We are a grassroots organization dedicated to breaking the barriers of education in underserved communities. Founded with a mission to provide quality education to children living in slum areas, we strive to create a nurturing learning environment where every child has the opportunity to thrive. Through innovative teaching methods, community engagement, and partnerships, we empower children with the knowledge and skills they need to build a brighter future. Our commitment extends beyond the classroom as we work towards bridging the educational gap and fostering long-term sustainable change in the lives of marginalized families.</p>

    <h2>Why Education is important?</h2>
    <h3>Breaking the cycle of poverty</h3>
    <p>Education offers underprivileged slum children a pathway out of poverty by providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to secure better opportunities in the future. By empowering them with education, these children can break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and create a brighter future for themselves and their families.</p>
    <h3>Empowerment and self-Improvement</h3>
    <p>Education empowers slum children to envision a life beyond their current circumstances. It instills in them a sense of self-worth and confidence, enabling them to dream big and pursue their aspirations. Through education, these children gain the tools to advocate for themselves, make informed decisions, and strive for a better quality of life.</p>
